# Module 1 - Coding Standards

## Reflection 1

I already implemented these coding standards in this projects:

- Clean code principles: clear variable and function names, simple and concise functions, non-redundant use of comments,
  consistent formatting powered by IntelliJ IDEA's auto-formatting features, modular code structure, null safety in
  error handling, and use of getters and setters for encapsulation.
- Secure coding practices: input validation for numeral inputs, use of getter-setters instead of direct field access,
  and use of random UUID instead of sequential numeric IDs for product IDs.

One of the challenges I faced while writing this program is to ensure that the name of HTML templates are the same as
return values of controller methods.
This is discovered when I encountered an error while adhering to the module documentation. To overcome this challenge, I
carefully reviewed the code and cross-checked the template names with the return values of the controller methods to
ensure they matched correctly.
